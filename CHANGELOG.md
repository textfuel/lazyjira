## [Unreleased]

- Configurable issue tabs with JQL templates and {{.ProjectKey}}/{{.UserEmail}} placeholders
- Create form prefills fields from active tab JQL (e.g. assignee from "Mine" tab)

- Custom field support in create form (select, multiselect, text, number)

- Config: `gui.prefillFromTab` option (default true)
- e2e test tape for issue creation flow

## [2.6.8] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- AUR PKGBUILD: pkgver() now uses git describe for tag-based versioning per Arch Wiki guidelines

## [2.6.7] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Text wrapping now measures display width of Unicode and emoji instead of counting bytes. Panels no longer overflow with multi-byte characters
- Info panel field values truncated by visual width instead of byte length
- ADF list markers use correct display width for indentation
- Stripped carriage returns from wiki markup and ADF text to prevent terminal corruption with Jira Server line endings

## [2.6.6] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Assignee list: current user now always appears first, matched by account ID instead of email. Fixes cases where Jira Cloud hides emails due to privacy settings (#16)
- Assignee modal now scrolls to keep the cursor visible when navigating long lists
- Selected project now pins to the top of the projects list
- Project keys that are reserved JQL words (like DO, IN, IS) no longer cause search errors

### Added

- Assignable users are cached per project and prefetched in background after project switch

## [2.6.5] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Search backspace now correctly deletes multi-byte Unicode characters instead of producing broken glyphs
- Issues list selection no longer jumps to top after confirming search

## [2.6.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew: switched back from Cask to Formula — Cask quarantines unsigned CLI binaries, causing macOS Gatekeeper to block execution

## [2.6.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew tap: removed stale Formula that shadowed the Cask, causing `brew upgrade` to stay on v2.4.0

## [2.6.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Homebrew formula not updating since v2.4.0: switched goreleaser from `homebrew_casks` back to `brews`

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Nix flake: switched from vendorHash to gomod2nix for reproducible builds
- CI: added nix build check to catch outdated dependency hashes
- CONTRIBUTING: added Nix dev environment section

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Jira Server and Data Center support (REST API v2) with automatic endpoint adaptation
- Client certificate authentication (mTLS): `certFile`, `keyFile`, `caFile`, `insecure` in config
- Setup wizard: choose between Cloud and Server/Data Center, prompts adapt accordingly
- Server/DC uses Bearer PAT auth (no email needed), Cloud keeps Basic auth
- Jira wiki markup rendering: bold, italic, links, headings, code blocks converted to plain text
- Error modal with red border for API errors (previously only shown in status bar)
- Issues list updates immediately after editing summary, status, or assignee
- Config: `serverType` field (`cloud`, `server`, `datacenter`) and TLS settings
- Environment variables: `JIRA_SERVER_TYPE`, `JIRA_TLS_CERT`, `JIRA_TLS_KEY`, `JIRA_TLS_CA`, `JIRA_TLS_INSECURE`
- README: clarified that API token and PAT are the same thing, added Server/DC setup instructions

### Fixed

- Edit Summary: long text now wraps instead of being truncated with "..."
- Edit Summary: space key now works (was silently ignored)
- Edit Summary: cursor at end of full line wraps to next line instead of breaking the border
- Edit Summary: ANSI escape codes no longer split across wrapped lines
- Confirm changes diff view: lines wrap instead of being truncated
- Description editor: opens with content on Server/DC (was empty due to ADF/string mismatch)
- Changelog tab: works on Server/DC (uses `?expand=changelog` instead of separate endpoint)
- Status panel: shows host when email is empty (Server/DC)

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
